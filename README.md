## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

#### Desktop Design

![Sample of the desktop design I built](./images/desktop-result.jpeg)

#### Mobile Design

I decided not to attach the mobile screenshot here since it is pretty much long so if you need to see it you can navigate to the [images directory](https://github.com/Code-Me-Well/four-card-feature-section-master/blob/main/images/mobile-result.png) and it should be there.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I might have underestimated the power of Flexbox. With Flexbox, I can accomplish major tasks in an easier way and with fewer lines of code. I mainly used it for responsiveness and especially to center my divs, which was always a challenge before.
